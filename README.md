# NodeJS Server Readme

## Getting Started

Before starting the NodeJS server, make sure to install all the required packages. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm i
This will install all the necessary packages for the server to function properly. Once the installation is complete, you can start the server using:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will initiate the server and make it ready to handle incoming requests.

Testing
For testing the server, we recommend using Postman, a popular API testing tool. The server is set to listen on localhost:3000.

Main Routes
The server has three main routes:

/students: This route is designed to handle operations related to student data.

/statistics: Use this route to fetch or manipulate statistical data.

/articles: For operations related to articles, this route is your go-to.
